Added Index and Contact pages, I Couldn't find a photo of me to easily use so I used a stock photo as a stand in.
CSS I used a dark style for my site, I added blue for the text and I did it for both pages, I belive all parts are known and accounted for I might want to change some of the colors later one 

Uploaded my site to GitHub pages 

I added a weather for Livonia Michigan, and used Open Metro because I ran into problems using the API Key version.
